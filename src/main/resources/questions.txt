Q:In a Turing machine, what is the role of the tape?
A:storage medium
Q:Which of the following is the first punch card computer?
A:Jacquard loom
Q:Please explain the role of the vacuum tubes in the ENIAC.
A:The role of the vacuum tubes in the ENIAC is that of an ON/OFF switch (1/0) that makes the calculations possible.

Q:name of the 5 electron atom to impurify silicon cristal for (n-type)?
A:phosphorous, arsenic
Q:name of the 3 electron atom to impurify silicon cristal for (p-type)?
A:boron
Q:The process of adding impurities to the silicon crystal to make it an electrical conductor is called ...
A:doping.
Q:The lack of the electron in the impurity atom (here, boron) is called a
A:hole
Q:How does the current flow in transistors?
A:The current flows from the source to the drain; the voltage at the gate regulates the flow
Q:What are the types of circuit and explain them
A:field portable gate array (FPGA) chips and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. The FPGA chips can be programmed or config ured at the field by the user, who is normally a manufacturer of electronic devices, such
as sound system equipment. ASIC chips are preprogrammed and cannot be modified by user
Q:What is the first step of a typical ASIC design flow?
A:collecting the customer’s requirements
Q:IN HDL Verilog language AND, OR, NOT, XOR
A:AND & OR | NOT ~ XOR^
Q:what is HDL?
A:Hardware description language (HDL) is a static description of the gate diagrams without any execution.
Q:One of the purposes of a hardware description language is logic synthesis, which refers to the process of
A:transforming the HDL code into a hardware’s netlist.
Q:Which of the following is an example of a hardware description language?
A:Verilog
Q:How to comment in Verilog?
A:/* comment is here */
Q:Is Verilog case-sensitive? True False
A:TRUE
